# Age Picker

Enhance `input[text="text"]` tags for collecting age with optional date selection, triggered by entering a year.

This will add invisible `select` tags to the DOM for choosing month and day on wireup. These dropdowns will occupy space while hidden to avoid UI related reshuffling.

## Installation

TODO
<!--
```
npm install age-picker
```
-->

## Usage

TODO

## Notes

Our use cases dictate collecting the month and day from the user. However, other or future use cases may allow for using today's date. By using today's date with a provided year age could be calculated. This feature does not currently exist, but was considered.

Initial plan is [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) using English language only.
